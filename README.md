# Data Cleaning and Visualization Process

## 1. Setting Up the Environment
- Install Python and necessary libraries, such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, to handle data analysis and visualization.

## 2. Loading the Dataset
- Use the provided `covid_death.csv` file, which includes information about COVID-19 deaths, total deaths, population, regions, and related statistics.
- The dataset will be loaded into a tool like Pandas for analysis. [You can use any other datasets: update code accordingly]
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/covid19-deaths-dataset)

## 3. Exploring the Dataset
- Examine the dataset to understand its structure, including the columns, data types, and the presence of any missing or invalid values.
- Preview the first few rows and identify areas requiring cleaning.

## 4. Data Cleaning
- **Removing Missing Values**: Drop any rows containing missing data to ensure consistency in analysis.
- **Converting Date Columns**: Convert columns like `start_date` and `end_date` into a date format to enable time-based analysis and sorting.
- **Saving Cleaned Data**: Save the cleaned version of the dataset for further use.

## 5. Visualizing the Data
- **a. Line Chart: COVID-19 Deaths Over Time**  
  Create a line chart to show how COVID-19 deaths have changed over time in a specific country.

- **b. Bar Chart: Excess Deaths by Region**  
  Use a bar chart to compare excess deaths across different regions and identify regions with the highest impact.

- **c. Scatter Plot: COVID-19 Deaths vs. Excess Deaths**  
  Use a scatter plot to examine the relationship between COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people and excess deaths per 100,000 people across regions.

## 6. Analyzing the Clean Data
  Using different methods to visualize and analyze the cleaned data

## 7. Summary
- The dataset was cleaned by removing missing values and formatting the date columns for consistency.
- Visualizations provided insights into trends in COVID-19 deaths, excess deaths, and regional impacts.
- The cleaned dataset was saved for future analysis.
